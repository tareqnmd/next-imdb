## Problem
Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of each other. One string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces/punctuation. Consider capital letter as same as lowercase.

## Output
```
anagram('funeral', 'real fun') => true
anagram('FUNERAL', 'ReAl! Fun') => true
anagram('Hello', 'World') => false
```
